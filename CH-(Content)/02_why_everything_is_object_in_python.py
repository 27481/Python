""" 
In Python, everything is an object because it is designed to be an object-oriented programming language. 
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that organizes data and behavior into objects that can interact with each other.

In Python, all data types, functions, and modules are objects. This means that they have attributes and methods that you can access and manipulate, just like any other object. For example, you can use the "type" function to check the type of an object, and you can use the "dir" function to list its attributes and methods: 
"""


x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
print(dir(x))   # ['__abs__', '__add__', '__and__', ... ]

"""

By treating everything as an object, Python provides a unified model for programming that allows you to use a consistent syntax and set of operations for all types of objects. This makes the language more expressive, flexible, and powerful.

Additionally, by treating everything as an object,
 Python allows you to define your own classes and create your own custom objects.
   This is a powerful feature of the language that enables you to create complex data structures, abstract away complexity, and encapsulate behavior.
