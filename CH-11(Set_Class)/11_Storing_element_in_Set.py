""" In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. One of the key properties of sets is that they can only store hashable data types as their elements.

A hashable data type is one that can be converted into a unique integer value, which is used to identify and access the element in the set. This integer value is known as a hash value, and it is calculated using a hash function.

The reason why sets can only store hashable data types is because the hash value of an element is used to determine its position in the set. If the hash value of an element changes, its position in the set will also change. This can cause problems with set operations such as membership testing, as the set may no longer be able to find the element in its original position.

Immutable data types, such as integers, floats, and strings, are hashable because their value cannot be changed once they are created. On the other hand, mutable data types, such as lists and dictionaries, cannot be hashed because their value can change over time. If a mutable element is modified in a way that changes its hash value while it is in the set, it will no longer be accessible in the set.

In summary, sets in Python can only store hashable data types because the hash value of an element is used to identify and access it in the set. Immutable data types are hashable because their value cannot be changed, while mutable data types are not hashable because their value can change over time. """
