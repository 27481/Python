# a/b ====> (float always) does not matter if a&b are of int type 

# / ======>>> true division which we do in mathmatics 

# In Python 3, the / operator always performs true division and returns a float, whereas the // operator performs integer division and returns an integer result.

""" Python implements true division by default because it is a more consistent and predictable behavior. By always returning a float, Python ensures that the result of division is accurate and precise, regardless of the operands involved.
