""" 
In Python, bitwise operators are a type of operator that perform bitwise operations on integer values. 
Bitwise operations are operations that work on the individual bits (binary digits) of an integer value, rather than on the value as a whole 
 """

#! There are 6 bitwise operators in Python:

    # & (AND): Performs a bitwise AND operation between the corresponding bits of two integers, and returns a new integer with the result.

    # | (OR): Performs a bitwise OR operation between the corresponding bits of two integers, and returns a new integer with the result.

    # ^ (XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation between the corresponding bits of two integers, and returns a new integer with the result.

    # ~ (NOT): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on an integer, which inverts all the bits of the integer (1s become 0s and 0s become 1s), and returns a new integer with the result.

    # << (LEFT SHIFT): Shifts the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions, and returns a new integer with the result.

    # >> (RIGHT SHIFT): Shifts the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions, and returns a new integer with the result.

# Bitwise operators are useful in low-level programming, such as working with binary data or hardware registers, and in certain types of optimization algorithms. However, they are less commonly used in general-purpose programming, where logical and arithmetic operators are more commonly used.
