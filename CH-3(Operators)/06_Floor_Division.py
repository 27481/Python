# floor division is a//b   (printing the value by removing the point)

# True divison is a/b   (it is always in float type does not matter if the numerator and denominator both are of float type python does this so that the divison is quit precise)

print(5//2); #! Floor division always gives integers (ie it removes points)
print(10//3);
print(25//5);
