# List

""" 
1> A List is a predefined class
2> List is an iterable sequence (any dataType is in sequence when data in the type is stored in sequence)
                                (all sequence are iterable but vice versa is not always true)
                                   one such example is 
                                           List, which is sequence and iterable too

3> List is mutable dataType 
4> List is growable
5> list can store hetrogeneous data (unlikely c)
6> List elements are indexed 
7> 


Python lists also have built-in functions and methods that make it easier to work with and manipulate lists.


what is class?

class is a group of variable and functions . They are collectively called attributes 
These attributes can be accessed from class by using object of the class 
          ex==> 
          A class name list is already predefined in python which have lots of 
          predefined variables and functions. 
          To access these attributes we need an object of class name List
