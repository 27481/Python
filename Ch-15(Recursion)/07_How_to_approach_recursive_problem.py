# How to approach recursive function 

"""  
# steps to approach recursive problem is 


Generally there are 3 steps involved in solving recursive problem i.e 

1> add(n) 1+2+3+.............+n
2> n+add(n-1)   1+2+3+..........+n-1     making Recursive Case
3> if n==1  return 1                     making base case
