#! format function 
# In Python, the format() function is used to format a string by replacing placeholders in the string with specified values. The format() function is a very powerful tool for creating dynamic strings that can be customized based on specific inputs.

The basic syntax of the format() function is as follows:

formatted_string = "Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old".format(name, age)

name = "Utkarsh"
age = 30
formatted_string = "Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old".format(name, age)
print(formatted_string)


#! You can also use numbered placeholders or named placeholders to specify the order of the arguments, or to use the same argument multiple times:

# Numbered placeholders
formatted_string = "Hello, my name is {0} and I am {1} years old. {0} is my name again.".format(name, age)
print(formatted_string)

# Named placeholders
formatted_string = "Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old".format(name="John", age=30)
print(formatted_string)
