Errors are of 3 Types 

1> compile time error  -> issue in syntax
2> Runtime error  -> it mostly occurs because of dataType and typecasting eg= 10/0 given as input by user
3> Logical error -> output is illogical 

fixing logical error is very difficult (it needs proper debugging and testing by tester)
