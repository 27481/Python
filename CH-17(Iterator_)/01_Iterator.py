# Iterator 

""" 
An iterator can be seen as a pointer to a container 


The iterator is an abstraction, 
because it enables the programmer to access all the elements of a containers without any deeper knowledge of the data strucutre of this container object {set,tuple, etc}

iterator is implicitly available in for loop 

*iterator works only on container object like (list,tuple) i.e it will not work on int and float because they are not cotainer object 

"""

#! container is object which can contains many object
