iterator object can only access elements in a sequence from first elements to the last elements 

next method is need to advances the iterator object 
there is no previous method to traverse object on the element in reverse direction 

Traversal is possible in  1 direction only 
Similarly,
        You can not randomly access the elements using iterator
