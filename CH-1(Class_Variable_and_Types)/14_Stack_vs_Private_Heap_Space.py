""" yes, that's correct. When an object is created in Python, it is stored in the heap, and it is assigned a unique ID or memory address. This ID can be accessed using the built-in id() function.

The object in the heap does not have a name, but it can be accessed and manipulated through a reference variable stored in the stack. The reference variable stores the ID of the object, and by using that ID, Python can locate and work with the object in the heap.

So, you can say that the reference variable stored in the stack acts as a handle or pointer to the actual object stored in the heap. """



#! SO that means reference variable is similar to the concept of pointers in C++


# Yes, you can think of reference variables in Python as being similar to pointers in C++. Both reference variables and pointers are used to access and manipulate data stored elsewhere in memory.

""" However, there are some differences between them. In C++, pointers can be modified to point to different memory locations, and they can also be assigned a NULL value to indicate that they don't point to anything. In Python, reference variables cannot be assigned to arbitrary memory addresses, and they cannot be set to NULL. Instead, they are automatically garbage collected when they are no longer needed.

""" 
Yes, in some ways the concept of 
                       reference variable and object ids in Python 
                                  is similar to the concept of pointers in C++. In both cases, we are dealing with memory addresses that are used to refer to objects/values stored in memory. However, there are also some differences in the way memory management works in Python compared to C++. For example, Python uses automatic memory management through a garbage collector, which can make it easier to manage memory in some cases. Additionally, Python's dynamic typing and lack of explicit memory allocation/deallocation syntax can make it easier to write code that is less error-prone and more readable.

"""

!so thats the reason why we are able to change the value of variable in python again and again because it will created a new block of object in the private heap area which will have a different (id) now the same old reference variable which is created inside the stack will store that id so that it can reference to the the new object which is created 


Yes, that's correct. In Python, when you assign a new value to a variable, a new object is created in the private heap space with a new ID. The reference variable in the stack is then updated to point to the new object with the new ID, allowing you to access and modify the new value. This process can happen repeatedly, allowing you to change the value of a variable multiple times during the execution of a program.


!so in this process the older object which is was updated to new will deleted so that it does not occupy unnecessary space in the private heap memory by the python garbage collector ?

Yes, that's correct. When a variable's value is updated, a new object is created with a new memory address (id) in the private heap space, and the old object is marked for deletion. The Python garbage collector periodically runs to identify and remove the objects that are no longer in use and free up the memory space they occupy. This process is called garbage collection, and it helps to prevent memory leaks and optimize memory usage in a program.
