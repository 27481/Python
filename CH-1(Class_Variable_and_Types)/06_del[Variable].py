""" 
In Python, del is a keyword that is used to delete an object or a variable from memory.

When you use the del keyword followed by a variable name, it removes the variable name and the reference to the object it was pointing to. This means that if there are no other references to that object in your code, it will become eligible for garbage collection and the memory it was using will be freed up.
Here's an example:

python

>>> x = 5
>>> del x
>>> print(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'x' is not defined

In this example, we create a variable x and assign it the value of 5. Then, we use the del keyword to delete the variable x. When we try to print the value of x after deleting it, we get a NameError because x is no longer defined in the current scope.

It's important to note that using del to remove a variable from memory is usually not necessary in Python, as the garbage collect """



""" It's important to note that using del to remove a variable from memory is usually not necessary in Python, 
as the garbage collector automatically frees up memory when an object is no longer referenced. 
However, there may be cases where using del can be useful, such as when you want to remove a reference 
  to an object to avoid unintentional modifications or to reduce memory usage in a specific situation. """
