!Variables are used to hold data during execution of the program

IN c/c++, You need to declare variable 
only after declaration you can use them 

int a;
float b;

In Python, you dont declare variable 
IF there is a need of a variable 
You think of a name and start using it as a variable

""" 

Every program needs some memory to run and 
Program gets its memory allocation from RAM

Memory is allocated in RAM till the program is executing
in that memory location we keep data and we call it 
variables

# In python we have to assign some value when we declare variable in python 
# unlikely C++ , where it is not necessary to assign some value to variable
