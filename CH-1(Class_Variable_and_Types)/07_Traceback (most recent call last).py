#! what is Trackback (most recent call last):

""" Traceback (most recent call last) is an error message that is printed by Python (or many other programming languages) when an exception (error) occurs during the execution of a program. """

""" This error message indicates that Python has encountered an exception, and it's providing information about where the error occurred in the code (the "most recent" part of the traceback) and the sequence of function calls that led up to the error. """


# For example, consider the following code:


def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

x = 5
y = 0
result = divide(x, y)


""" In this code, we define a function called divide that takes two arguments and returns their quotient. We then create two variables x and y, and try to divide x by y, which will result in a ZeroDivisionError because we are trying to divide by zero.

When we run this code, Python will raise a ZeroDivisionError and print a traceback that looks something like this: """




Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "example.py", line 6, in <module>
    result = divide(x, y)
  File "example.py", line 2, in divide
    return a / b
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero



""" 
This traceback tells us that the error occurred in divide function, at line 2, and was triggered by the line 6 in the main program, 
where we called the divide function with x=5 and y=0. By examining the traceback, we can identify where the error occurred in the code and use that information to debug and fix the problem.
