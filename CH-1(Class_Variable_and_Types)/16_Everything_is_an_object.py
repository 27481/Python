""" so thats why we say everything in python is an object because python works on
    the principle of object , object id and reference variable 
"""




""" Yes, that's correct! In Python, everything is an object, which means that every value in Python is represented as an object with a unique ID and a set of attributes and methods that define its behavior.

Python's use of objects, object IDs, and reference variables 
                                                        is fundamental to its programming model, and is one of the key features that makes Python such a powerful and flexible language.

By using objects to represent values, Python allows you to write code that is both concise and expressive, while still providing a rich set of built-in data types and libraries to work with.

By using object IDs and reference variables, Python allows you to manipulate objects directly, without worrying about the underlying implementation details, such as memory management or low-level data structures.

Overall, the use of objects, object IDs, and reference variables is one of the core principles that makes Python a great language for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. """
