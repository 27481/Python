# In Python, the eval() function is a built-in function that allows you to evaluate a string as if it were a Python expression. It takes a single argument, which is the string containing the expression to be evaluated.

#! Here's a simple example:

x = 5
result = eval("x * 2")
print(result)  # Output: 10


""" 
In this example, the eval() function is used to evaluate the string "x * 2" as a Python expression, where x is a variable with the value 5. The result of the expression is 10, which is then stored in the variable result.

The eval() function can be useful in situations where you need to dynamically evaluate expressions that are defined as strings, such as when you're building a calculator or a scripting language.

However, it's important to use eval() with caution, as it can be a security risk if you're evaluating untrusted user input. If the string passed to eval() contains malicious code, it could potentially execute that code on your system.
"""


#! so in short eval() evaluate the string if it contains any special symbol or not 

""" 
Yes, that's a good way to put it. eval() evaluates a string as a Python expression, which means that it will interpret any special symbols (like arithmetic operators or variable names) according to the rules of the Python language. This makes it a powerful and flexible tool for performing calculations or executing dynamic code, but it also carries some risks if you're not careful with how you use it.
"""

#! what if i give only number in the input()  i mean im not giving any special symbol so there is nothing to evaluate so how will eval() function work


# If you give eval() a string that doesn't contain any special symbols or operators, it will still try to evaluate the string as a Python expression, but the result will simply be the same as the input string.

# For example, if you pass the string "42" to eval(), it will try to evaluate it as a Python expression, but since there are no operators or special symbols, the result will just be the integer 42.

# This behavior is not particularly useful in cases where you just want to convert a string to an integer, since you can achieve that more efficiently and safely using the built-in int() function. However, it can be useful in more complex scenarios where you need to evaluate dynamic expressions that might include variables or operators that are not known in advance
