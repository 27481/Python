# Program based on single (line if else) we count it as (expression)

""" 
WAP a python program to check whether a given number is positive or non positive 
using single line (if else)
"""

num=int(input("Enter the number you want to check:\n"));

result= "positive" if num>0 else "non-negative";

print(result);

#! Python is known for its precise coding so we often use one liner 

print("Positive" if int(input("Enter the number:\n"))>0 else "Non-Positive");



#!Note ===>> make an effort to write our code in less line by doing this we are adopting that freature of python  for which python is famous
