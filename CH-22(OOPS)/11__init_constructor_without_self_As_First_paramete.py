# In Python, using self as the first parameter in the __init__ method (or any other instance method) is a convention, and it's not a strict requirement imposed by the language. However, it is highly recommended and widely followed.

# If you don't use self as the first parameter in the __init__ method, you won't be able to refer to the instance variables within the method because self is the reference to the instance of the class. Without it, Python won't know which instance you're trying to access, and you'll likely encounter errors.


class MyClass:
    def __init__(x, y):
        # This will result in an error because there's no reference to the instance (self)
        x.x = y

# Attempting to create an instance will result in an error.
obj = MyClass(42)
