# 1> If the key already exits in the dict then data will edited 
# 2> If the key do not exists then the new element will be added i.e new key:value pair
# 3> we can delete a key, and then create a new key of same name and assign new data 


# Syntax of (add) and (edit) in dict is same but depends if the on the value if its already exits in the dict or not 

if key exits then it will editing , if the key does not exits then it will be adding
